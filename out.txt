One approach to debugging it would be to write it to a text file and then open that with an editor suitable for HTML.

A sample demonstrating your issue woud  help.  Without that I would suggest using double quotes on the outside and single quotes on the inside, or vice versa:

I used chr(34) to represent the double quote like this:
stMessage = &quot;&lt;BODY style=&quot; &amp; Chr(34) &amp; &quot;font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri&quot; &amp; Chr(34) &amp; &quot;&gt;&quot;
